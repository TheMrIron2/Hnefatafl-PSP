# Hnefatafl PSP

Hnefatafl PSP is a port of [LFalch's Rust implementation](https://github.com/LFalch/hnefatafl) of historic Viking board game Hnefatafl.

Hnefatafl (pronounced "nef-ah-taf-fel", meaning "King's Table") is a 1,600 year old board game made popular in Scandinavia by the Vikings, with various derivatives existing in other countries. This port uses the [traditional Copenhagen Hnefatafl rules](http://aagenielsen.dk/copenhagen_rules.php) with an 11x11 board.

## Details

For its initial release, Hnefatafl PSP aims to be an online multiplayer implementation of Tafl. It will use the standard rules as outlined above, and will have 2D graphics representing the board and pieces.

## What is Hnefatafl?
(For a more complete breakdown, see the rules linked above.)

Hnefatafl, sometimes known as "Viking chess", is a Scandinavian game derived from the Tafl family of board games.

Under the popular Copenhagen rules, a board - typically 11x11 in size - is set up with 24 attackers (black) and 12 defenders, plus a "king" (white). Board size may vary, but the ratio of attackers to defenders remains the same.

In order for white to win the game, the king must reach the corner of the board. Black's objective is to prevent the king from doing so.
All pieces may move any number of spaces in any direction, but not diagonally.

The game is intuitive and accessible, and the difference in strategy between black and white keeps the game fresh and enjoyable to this day.

## Future Plans
NOTE: These plans are not guaranteed to happen, and are all long-term goals.

- Local multiplayer
- Singleplayer vs. computer
- 3D graphics
- Music and sound effects
- Additional rule sets and board sizes (eg. Tablut, Brandubh, Ard-RÃ­... see [list of Tafl games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games))

Special thanks to LFalch for his work on the original web-based project; without this, the PSP port would never have existed.
